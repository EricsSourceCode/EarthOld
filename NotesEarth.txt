Axis of moon's orbit.
Lunar Nodal Precession.
It takes about 18.5 years for the moon's nodes,
where they cross the ecliptic, to move 360 degrees.

23 hours, 56 minutes
The earth rotates once every 23 hours,
56 minutes and 4.09053 seconds, called the
sidereal period, and its circumference is
roughly 40,075 kilometers

It has to be based on the real data you can get.

I have the velocity vectors in the JPL data,
so I can use that for the coordinate system at

// "A simplex may be defined as the smallest convex

// "Henri Poincar , writing about algebraic topology
// in 1900, called them generalized tetrahedra".



// Convex set:
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set
// "convex region is a region where, for every pair
// of points within the region, every point on the
// straight line segment that joins the pair of
// points is also within the region."
